##Purpose##
This is a project full of scripts that I use to analyze different aspects of Biblical texts, usually in the original languages.

By default, use Python.

Each top-level python script attempts to do one "analysis". It should output its results into {scriptname}-Results.txt.

When reading Hebrew texts, deduplicate ketiv/qere, keeping the qere.
